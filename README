The images can be created by using the command:
- bash setup.sh

This ensures image creation of all tests, as well as the activation of the docker-compose.

To launch the individual containers, we can use commands:
- docker container run -p 8000:8000 datascientest/fastapi:1.0.0
- docker container run -p 5000:5000 -d authent_image:latest
- docker container run -p 6000:6000 -d author_image:latest
- docker container run -p 7000:7000 -d content_image:latest

To query the tests in a different terminal, we use:
Authentication:   curl -X GET -i http://localhost:5000
Authorization:    curl -X GET -i http://localhost:6000
Content:          curl -X GET -i http://localhost:7000

The content of the tests can be altered inside the python scripts themselves,
then the different outcomes of the tests can be observed.
